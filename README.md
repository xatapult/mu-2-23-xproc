# XProc - A pipeline language - Markup UK 2023

[XProc 3.0](https://xproc.org/index.html) is an XML based programming language for complex document processing. Documents flow through pipelines in which steps perform processing like conversion, validation, split, merge, report, etc. Itâ€™s an almost perfect fit for the kind of complex processing necessary in XML document engineering.

[Markup UK 2023](https://markupuk.org/index.html) (June 1-3, London) is a conference about XML and other Markup Technologies. There will be several tutorials, one of these an introduction to XProc 3.0.

The [mu-2023-xproc GitHub repository](https://github.com/xatapult/mu-2023-xproc) hosts all materials (presentations, exercises, etc.) for this tutorial. 

For more information, see the [accompanying GitHub pages site](https://mu-2023-xproc.xatapult.com/).

This tutorial is a rerun from a tutorial given at [Declarative Amsterdam](https://declarative.amsterdam/) in 2021.
